# NLP-for-ChatGPT-Reviews
The main idea for this project is explore a Kaggle dataset about ChatGPT reviews using a NLP approach in order to apply ML models for score reviews predictions. I applied LIME algorithm to evaluate explainability about text classifiers. Should it be possible to apply complex network? Let's try.

The dataset in [this folder](Data/) comes from this Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishkumarak/chatgpt-reviews-daily-updated/data
